                <p>Henrys concept for the book is simple and yet powerful: each subject is presented using only 2 pages: one page elaborating on the subject and another page showing an image that illustrates how the subject presented has been applied by another photographer. So it is full of illustrations of how the principles and advice presented in the book has been used or applied by other photographers.</p>
                <p>his book is part of a series – Henry has written books more focused on say portrait photography or pictures of places. But this one is the basic one – the 101 so to speak. Yet it managers to cover both the very basics photography like exposure and the more artistic dimension to photography. And he does it in a way where the subjects are wove into each other in a very elegant way so you really don’t notice how much ground this little 140 pages book covers.

                    You will find books that are dedicated to say exposure, which this book deals with in a matter of a few pages. So of course you will not get all the details and all the angles. But you will get a very good grid or overview of what you need to know about photography, and then you can branch out from this book to other sources with more details.</p>

                <p>Wings of Fire is set in a world made up of two known continents that are predominantly populated by dragons: Pyrrhia (the focus of books 1-10) and Pantala (the focus of books 11-15). While Pyrrhia is home to seven tribes (MudWings, SandWings, SkyWings, SeaWings, RainWings, IceWings, NightWings), Pantala houses only three tribes (HiveWings, SilkWings, LeafWings), and hybrid dragons also exist in the world on both continents. With a few exceptions to each rule, each tribe lives in a habitat suited to its biological needs and abilities, is ruled by a royal queen, and generally exists independently of the other tribes. Both continents are also inhabited by humans (called "scavengers" by Pyrrhian dragons and from LeafWing myth or "reading monkeys" by some Pantalan dragons), who are viewed by most dragons as inferior animals and are often eaten,[4] although interactions between humans and dragons are explored throughout the series.[5]</p>

                <p>I’ve always considered myself a risk-averse person. Whenever I assess the pros and cons of a situation, the fear of the negative outcome pushes me to play it safe. For most of my adult life, I’ve let that fear guide me—until my junior year of college.

                    Despite the many unknowns, I decided to study abroad in France. I had no idea how I would support myself financially, no friends or family in the area, and a limited (but growing) knowledge of the culture, customs, and language. Still, with my education winding down, I was determined to have a new experience. I worked hard to secure a scholarship and overcame every obstacle to make it happen. All of it made me think: Maybe I’m capable of more than I used to imagine.
